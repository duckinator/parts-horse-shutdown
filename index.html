      <h1>Parts Horse is shut down (at least for now)</h1>

      <h2>Why?</h2>

      <p>Parts Horse has existed for over 3 years! I started it in December 2018, and there was only a few days of downtime until there was some kind of weird TLS error in January or February 2022.</p>
      <p>However, during those 3 years, I was never able to get someone to help me prioritize what components to add documentation for. In fact, nobody even said they used it.</p>
      <p>After 3 years, I've decided it's too much of a burden to maintain entirely for myself &mdash; at least in its current form.</p>

      <h2>What now?</h2>

      <p>Short-term, the current server has been shut down &mdash; it was malfunctioning, annoyingly complicated, and terribly outdated. But most importantly, it's reproducible, so I can spin up a similarly malfunctioning system if I change my mind!</p>
      <p>My vague, long-term plan is to convert Parts Horse to an entirely static website. It's already <em>mostly</em> static, but not quite there yet. We'll probably lose the search functionality, but that was never working quite right anyway.</p>

      <h2>Okay but what if I wanted to use it?</h2>
      
      <p>Head over to <a href="https://github.com/duckinator/parts.horse/issues/112">Parts Horse issue #112</a> and let me know. The more folks who express their interest, the more likely I am to come back to this project.</p>
